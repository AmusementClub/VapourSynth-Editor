THIS MANUAL IS A DRAFT. PLEASE REPORT ANY MISTAKES OR ADDITIONS AT https://github.com/YomikoR/VapourSynth-Editor/issues

Building VapourSynth Editor from source:

1) make sure you meet the prerequisites explained below;
2) open the system terminal and change working directory to the "pro" directory in the source tree;
3) execute following command to generate the Makefile and other intermediate files

    `qmake -norecursive pro.pro CONFIG+=release`

4) "make" the Makefile with the specific make-tool:
"make" if you are on Linux or using MSys on Windows;
"mingw32-make" for MinGW;
"nmake" for MS Visual Studio;
program files will be built in compiler specific sub-directory in the "build" directory in source tree and ready to use.

Each compiler you choose for build targets must specify "QT5BINPATH" custom environment variable with the directory of Qt5 toolchain executables.

Prerequisites

You need C++17 (or higher) compiler and Qt5 development distribution with version no less than 5.8 corresponding to the compiler.
Make sure the executable directories of both tools are included in PATH system environment variable.

Windows:

- get compiler of your choice (MinGW and MSVC are fully supported);
- if you use MSVC - you might also need to install Windows SDK. If you experience any problems during the building related to missing headers or "unresolved externals", you may consider opening the file "pro/local_quirks.pri" with text editor or your IDE and change the paths to headers and libraries to those that correspond to your MSVC and Windows SDK installation paths.
- get Qt5 distribution (https://www.qt.io).

Linux:

- install following packages: build-essential, qtbase5-dev; also be aware that in some cases QtWebSockets is a standalone package.
- if your Linux distribution has Qt4 development packages installed - you might want to install package qt5-default.

MacOS:

 - if you are a user of brew, install qt@5.
